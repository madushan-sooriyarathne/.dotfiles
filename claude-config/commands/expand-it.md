# Expand It

The input for this exercise is design-system/competitor-analysis.md

Expand on each of your respective views expressed inside of the Pondering tags analysis. Specifically, I want you to return inside of each Style Guide a **"How To Leverage"** and **"Philosophy"** section that the Lead Designer of this project gives to all new employees so that they understand properly how to leverage the style guide properly.

Once done, add your comprehensive Style Guide (how to leverage, philosophy, as well as the raw style guide) into design-system/styles.md
