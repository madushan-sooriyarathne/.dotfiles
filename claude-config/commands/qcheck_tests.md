# qcheck_tests

Perform skeptical test-specific code review against Writing Tests Best Practices

## Usage

```
/qcheck_tests
```

## Examples

```bash
# Review all major test changes made in the session
/qcheck_tests

# Expected output when checklist is available:
# 🔍 SKEPTICAL TEST REVIEW - Senior Engineer Analysis
#
# 📋 Analyzing MAJOR test changes only (skipping minor tweaks)...
#
# 🧪 Test Suite: `user-service.test.js`
# ✓ Writing Tests Best Practices (CLAUDE.md):
#   ✓ Test names clearly describe what is being tested
#   ✓ Tests are properly isolated and independent
#   ⚠️ Missing edge case tests for null/undefined user inputs
#   ✗ Test `should handle user creation` is testing multiple behaviors
#   ✓ Proper setup and teardown implemented
#   ⚠️ Mock data is hardcoded - consider using test fixtures
#
# 🧪 Test: `it('should validate email format correctly')`
# ✓ Writing Tests Best Practices (CLAUDE.md):
#   ✓ Test name is descriptive and specific
#   ✓ Single assertion per test maintained
#   ✓ Tests both valid and invalid email scenarios
#   ✓ No external dependencies or side effects
#   ⚠️ Could benefit from more boundary condition testing
#   ✓ Clear arrange-act-assert structure

# Expected output when checklist is missing:
# ❌ Missing checklist: "Writing Tests Best Practices" not found in CLAUDE.md
#
# 🤔 Should I add a "Writing Tests Best Practices" checklist to CLAUDE.md
#    based on this project's testing framework and patterns? (y/n)
```

## Description

This command performs a focused, skeptical code review specifically for test-related changes made during the session. Acting as a senior software engineer, it validates all major test additions and modifications against the "Writing Tests Best Practices" checklist from CLAUDE.md, providing detailed feedback on test design, coverage, and quality.

This command will:

- Identify all MAJOR test changes made during the session (new tests, significant edits)
- Apply skeptical analysis to each test and test suite individually
- Check against Writing Tests Best Practices from CLAUDE.md
- Flag missing checklist and offer to create it based on project testing patterns
- Provide specific, test-level feedback and improvement suggestions

## Implementation

The command should:

1. **Test Change Identification**
   - Scan session history for all test-related modifications
   - Filter out minor changes (formatting, small assertion tweaks, comments)
   - Focus on MAJOR changes: new test files, new test cases, significant test logic changes
   - Identify both unit tests and integration tests that need review

2. **Checklist Validation**
   - Look specifically for "Writing Tests Best Practices" checklist in CLAUDE.md
   - If checklist is missing, note it and ask permission to add it
   - Parse the checklist items for systematic evaluation

3. **Skeptical Test Analysis**
   - Adopt a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer mindset for each test
   - Question every test design decision and implementation choice
   - Look for potential gaps in coverage, flaky tests, and best practice violations
   - Be thorough and critical about test quality and effectiveness

4. **Per-Test/Suite Review Process**
   - Analyze each major test file and test case individually
   - Display test names and brief context
   - Apply all checklist items from "Writing Tests Best Practices"
   - Provide specific feedback for each checklist item

5. **Test-Specific Best Practices Check**
   - **Test Names**: Descriptive, clear, and follow "should/when/given" patterns
   - **Test Structure**: Proper arrange-act-assert or given-when-then organization
   - **Test Isolation**: Tests are independent and don't rely on execution order
   - **Single Responsibility**: Each test verifies one specific behavior
   - **Coverage**: Edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values tested
   - **Assertions**: Clear, specific assertions that fail meaningfully
   - **Test Data**: Appropriate use of fixtures, mocks, and test data
   - **Performance**: Tests run efficiently without unnecessary delays
   - **Maintainability**: Tests are easy to understand and modify

6. **Test Coverage Analysis**
   - Evaluate if new functionality has corresponding tests
   - Check for missing edge cases and error scenarios
   - Assess integration test coverage for complex workflows
   - Identify over-testing or redundant test cases

7. **Missing Checklist Handling**
   - If "Writing Tests Best Practices" is missing from CLAUDE.md
   - Ask user permission to add the checklist
   - If permitted, analyze the project's testing framework and patterns
   - Generate appropriate test best practices tailored to the project's testing approach
   - Add the new checklist to CLAUDE.md

8. **Detailed Feedback Generation**
   - Use clear symbols: ✓ (compliant), ⚠️ (warning/suggestion), ✗ (violation)
   - Provide specific examples and test case references when possible
   - Suggest concrete improvements for each identified issue
   - Include code snippets or examples of better test patterns
   - Prioritize feedback by impact on test reliability and maintainability

9. **Test Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluate test readability and maintainability
   - Check for proper error message clarity when tests fail
   - Assess test execution speed and efficiency
   - Review mock usage and test doubles appropriateness

10. **Summary and Recommendations**
    - Provide an overall assessment of test suite quality
    - Highlight patterns of issues across multiple tests
    - Suggest broader testing improvements or refactoring opportunities
    - Recommend next steps for addressing identified testing gaps
    - Flag potential flaky tests or reliability concerns
